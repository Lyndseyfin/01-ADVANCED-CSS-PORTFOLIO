# 02-ADVANCED-CSS-PORTFOLIO
Second Assignment

## HTML
- I created this from the ground up using semantic HTML tags and personal work links + images
- I inserted a personal image of mine as a placeholder to be replaced with future projects

### CSS
- I styled my page the best I could! Very dificult for me and defintely a work in progress but I believe it all works accordingly
